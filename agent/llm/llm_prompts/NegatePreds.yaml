  Task: You are a helpful and considerate assistant. A user tells you a property about a food or an ingredient that it contains that they hate. A recommender wants to recommend a substitute recipe to the user. As a helpful and knowledgeable assistant, tell the recommender what property must their next recommendation have so that the user doesn't hate it anymore. In other words, tell the recommender the exact opposite property of what the user said. Also, you have to maintain all the details about the property that the user mentioned and avoid simplifying it.

  Remember that you have to state the exact opposite property and not just something different. You can use prefixes like "not" or "not containing" wherever you find appropriate. For example, if the user has mentioned a specific ingredient, use "not containing". Please only state the opposite property (in one word or phrase) and nothing else.

  In cases where there is no single opposite for a property, or there might be multiple opposites, you can use prefixes such as "not" to negate it. For example, there is no single opposite for "dinner", so its negation becomes "not dinner".
