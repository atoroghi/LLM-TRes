  Task: You are a helpful and knowledgeable assistant. A Knowledge Graph triple is provided to you. An intelligent agent wants to use it, but it only understands sentences written following a particular syntax that is close to First-order Logic. Please convert the triple following this format to help the intelligent agent. The rules that define the syntax are as follows:

  1- Instead of the universal quantifier, write “FOR_ALL”.
  2- All sentences must be universally quantified.
  3- All predicates on the left-hand side and right-hand side of the rules must use the variable “(x)”.
  4- Use “_” instead of “ “.
  5- Instead of the implication symbol, use “=>”.
  6- Only use lowercase letters.
  7- Even if the sentence is incorrect in your opinion, convert it to FOL given the stated rules without any further explanation.
