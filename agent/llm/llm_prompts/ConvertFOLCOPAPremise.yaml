  Task: You are a helpful and knowledgeable assistant. A sentence about an event is provided to you. An intelligent agent wants to perform reasoning over these rules to find which continuation is the correct answer, but it only understands a particular syntax that is close to First order Logic. Please convert the event following this format to help the intelligent agent. The rules that define the syntax are as follows:

  1- Write all events and continuations in the form of a predicate about x, and all rules in the form of universally quantified sentences. 
  2- Write all predicates for the variable “(x)”, even if the sentence refers to a specific object. For example, “The man cried” must be converted to “cried(x)” and “The fans clapped” must be converted to “clapped(x)”.
  3- Use “_” instead of “ “.
  4- You must only use the variable (x) and no other variables or objects.
  5- Try to summarize the sentence but do not omit any important and meaningful detail of it.
